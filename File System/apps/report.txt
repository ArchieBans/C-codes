Report File LLFS.

Design.

I have used 31 blocks for my workings of the file system. When you initialize() the disk you see more details on that.
Currently with one block pointer for each group the max file size system can store is 10 blocks or 5120 bytes. The groups are nothing
but array pointer storing the block nums that has data for that node. There are 15 blocks assigned to the checkpoint functionality that 
saves the file system from crashes. Those 15 blocks contains the checkpoints inodes, directory and free block vector.

Implementation decisions and tradeoff.

Well becuase there was not much said about the indirect pointer so I have left the functionality out the tests. But in an effort to increase
the storage of max file size a functionality has been put in the system that can store 20 datablocks. More that 10,000 bytes. But the read is no there
yet for this function.
It was very challenging on how to divide the space for directory and inodes. Currently in the system there are 96 inodes and 64 directory entries.There are 
very small numbers but the do work what they are supposed to do. The main tradeoff I feel is that not having enough space allocated for the inodes. If there 
are more inodes then system can store much more. It's NTFS everything is connected and max size if 256Terbabytes of that system. But for my version of LLFS
it is 5120 bytes.

I want to thank the instructor for exposing us to this neat assignment. It gave me a lot of prespective on what is actually going on with my machine.
